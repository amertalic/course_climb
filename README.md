# Course Progress
## Introduction
This Python script processes a specified root folder containing course materials. It traverses through the folders and computes the progress based on a specific naming convention where folders beginning with [Done] are considered completed sections.

# Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command:


```
python manin.py path/to/courses/root/folder
```
Replace path with the actual path to your Python script.

# Output

**Please note: The program requires manually renaming folders that are marked as done by prefixing them with [Done].**
